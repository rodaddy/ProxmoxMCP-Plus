## Release History

### Version `0.4.9`

- Release date: 2026-05-09
- Summary: supersedes `v0.4.8` with the same reliability hardening plus a CodeQL-blocking log-injection fix for high-risk retry audit logs.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - no new tools
- Changed behavior:
  - high-risk retry audit logs sanitize job IDs and persisted tool names before logging
  - all `v0.4.8` production reliability changes are included
- Config changes:
  - no required config migration
- Docs updated:
  - `docs/releases/v0.4.9.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Release & Upgrade Notes.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - prefer `v0.4.9` over `v0.4.8`
  - continue passing `include_stats=true` to `get_containers` if callers require detailed stats by default
- Rollback notes:
  - use `v0.4.7` rather than `v0.4.8` if rollback is required for the log-sanitization fix

### Version `0.4.8`

- Release date: 2026-05-09
- Summary: production reliability and release-quality hardening for persistent jobs, inventory reads, OpenAPI job controls, metrics, Paramiko tracking, and `clone_vm`.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - no new tools
- Changed behavior:
  - `clone_vm` now registers persistent jobs and returns a stable Job ID
  - high-risk job retries now pass through the same approval-token policy checks as direct tool execution
  - VM guest-agent commands poll until exit and report non-zero exit codes as failures
  - `get_vms` and default `get_containers` use cluster resource inventory to avoid large N+1 scans
  - `get_containers` defaults `include_stats=false`; detailed per-container status/config/RRD remains opt-in
  - OpenAPI metrics use route templates instead of raw paths for request labels
  - `JobStore` SQLite uses WAL, busy timeout, migration tracking, indexes, SQL filtering/limits, and explicit close lifecycle
- Config changes:
  - no required config migration
  - runtime dependency support now allows `paramiko>=4.0.0,<5.0.0`
- Docs updated:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/releases/v0.4.8.md`
  - `docs/security/paramiko-cve-2026-44405.md`
  - `docs/wiki/API & Tool Reference.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Developer Guide.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Home.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Release & Upgrade Notes.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - pass `include_stats=true` to `get_containers` if callers require detailed stats by default
  - monitor Paramiko releases and remove the temporary `CVE-2026-44405` audit exception once a fixed PyPI release exists
- Rollback notes:
  - downgrade to `v0.4.7` if clients depend on default container stats, but keep the Paramiko CVE tracking in mind

### Version `0.4.7`

- Release date: 2026-05-08
- Summary: adds a Docker-native MCP Streamable HTTP runtime so remote MCP clients can connect to `/mcp` without going through the OpenAPI bridge.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - Docker Compose profile `mcp-http` exposes native MCP Streamable HTTP at `http://<host>:8000/mcp`
- Changed behavior:
  - the Docker image now starts through `proxmox_mcp.docker_entrypoint`
  - OpenAPI mode remains the default Docker runtime on port `8811`
  - `MCP_HOST`, `MCP_PORT`, and `MCP_TRANSPORT` can override the `mcp` section from a mounted config file
- Config changes:
  - optional `PROXMOX_MCP_MODE=mcp-http` selects native MCP HTTP mode in Docker
- Docs updated:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/releases/v0.4.7.md`
  - `docs/wiki/API & Tool Reference.md`
  - `docs/wiki/Integrations Guide.md`

### Version `0.4.6`

- Release date: 2026-05-02
- Summary: fixes API tunnel routing, cross-process job visibility, secret persistence in LXC retry specs, snapshot rollback safety, and storage status node selection.
- Changed behavior:

  - OpenAPI `/jobs` refreshes persisted SQLite records before reads and job controls
  - `create_container` no longer persists retry recipes when container passwords or SSH public keys are present

  - `get_storage` queries status through real Proxmox nodes instead of `localhost`
- Config changes:
  - no required config changes
- Docs updated:
  - `docs/releases/v0.4.6.md`
- Upgrade steps:

  - if you use snapshot rollback, explicitly delete newer child snapshots before retrying rollback

### Version `0.3.0`

- Release date: 2026-04-24
- Summary: adds a persistent SQLite-backed job layer for long-running Proxmox tasks, direct OpenAPI job routes, richer OpenAPI operational endpoints, and plugin-based tool registration.
- New tools or endpoints:
  - MCP tools: `list_jobs`, `get_job`, `poll_job`, `cancel_job`, `retry_job`
  - OpenAPI routes: `GET /jobs`, `GET /jobs/{job_id}`, `POST /jobs/{job_id}/poll`, `POST /jobs/{job_id}/cancel`, `POST /jobs/{job_id}/retry`
  - OpenAPI route: `/metrics`
- Changed behavior:
  - async mutating tools now return a stable `job_id` in addition to raw Proxmox `task_id`
  - tool registration now flows through built-in registry plugins instead of one growing `server.py` block
  - high-risk operations can be policy-gated separately from command execution
- Removed or deprecated behavior:
  - none
- Config changes:

  - new optional `api_tunnel` section
  - expanded `command_policy` with high-risk operation controls
- Docs updated:

  - `docs/wiki/Developer Guide.md`
- Upgrade steps:
  - add a persistent path for `jobs.sqlite_path` in long-lived deployments
  - update config from `proxmox-config/config.example.json`
  - if you depend on async tooling, switch client logic to keep `job_id` and not just `task_id`
  - if you use OpenAPI, update monitors and clients to account for `/metrics` and `/jobs`
- Rollback notes:
  - older versions cannot read back persisted jobs through `/jobs`
  - clients written against `job_id` should be reverted together with the server downgrade

## Suggested Upgrade Checklist

Before upgrading:

- review changes to config examples
- review command policy defaults
- review OpenAPI wrapper behavior if your deployment depends on `/health` or auth
- check whether any new tool requires extra credentials or runtime dependencies

After upgrading:

- start the service and confirm config validation still passes
- call `get_nodes` and `get_cluster_status`
- verify expected tools are still registered
- verify `/health` and `/docs` if you run the OpenAPI proxy
- test at least one mutating workflow in a safe environment

## Suggested Release Checklist

- run `pytest -q --cov=proxmox_mcp --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=60`
- run `ruff check .`
- run `mypy src --ignore-missing-imports`
- run `pip-audit -r requirements.txt --ignore-vuln CVE-2026-44405`
- build the package
- confirm `README.md` and `docs/wiki/` reflect the released behavior
- note any user-visible changes here
